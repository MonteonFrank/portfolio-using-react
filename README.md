#Portfolio using React


<h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>

<p>During these last weeks we learned about React which allows developers to build reusable UI components, making it easy to create complex UIs. t also uses a virtual DOM, which means it can render changes to the UI more efficiently, resulting in faster performance.</p>

<p>The purpose of this application was to create a portfolio using React which allowed me to demostrate the skill learned during class. On this specific application, we have the About Me, Resume, Contact and Project Portfolio sections. For the About Me and Resume sections, not much funcionality was created since they only contain a small description of myself as well as the tecnologies we have learned during the bootmap.</p>

<p>For the Contact section, the user will be able to find an input field for their name, email and a textarea to put a message. Since we were told not to concentrat on the backend, I only created the functionality of adding the user name, emial and test into the console, to ensure that the button worked. For this section, an alert will come out it the field of name, email and textarea are not entered.</p>

<p>For the portfolio section, you will find 6 images of deployed applications as well as their link to their github repositories. For this section, I used flexbox to ensure the page was repsonsive.</p>


<h2><strong>Programming Logic</strong></h2>

<p>To create the page, I used components for the footer, header, navbars and the portfolio container. Additionally, I created pages for the About Me, Contact, Portfolio and Resume which are rendered in the portfolio container. </p>

<p>For the Contact page, I used the UseState method to handle the inforation provided from the user, while on the Navbar, I used conditional formating from bootstrap to render the button to have a visual of the page the user is in. For the portfolio section, I used the card format to add each project as well as flexbox to order them properly</p>



<h2><strong>What did I learn?</strong></h2>

 <p>During this challenge I learned more about React and its advantages. I have to admit that I struggled with the useState method and actually used several pieces of code viewed in class, such as the creation of the NavBar.t.</p>
